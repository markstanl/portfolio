# Portfolio V2
This is the second version of my portfolio. It is a simple website that showcases my projects and skills. 
The website is built using NextJS, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
Content is managed using Sanity CMS, which allows for easy updates and management of the content.
I am quite the fan after using it for a little bit now.
This website contains the classic landing page, as well as a blog section.
